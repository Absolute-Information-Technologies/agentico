# Next Steps for Deploying Agentico to AWS EC2

We've prepared all the necessary files for deploying your Next.js application to AWS EC2 using Docker. Here's a summary of what we've created and what you need to do next.

## Files Created

1. **Docker Configuration**
   - `Dockerfile` - Multi-stage build for your Next.js application
   - `.dockerignore` - Excludes unnecessary files from Docker build
   - `docker-compose.yml` - Defines the services (Next.js and Nginx)

2. **Nginx Configuration**
   - `nginx/conf.d/default.conf` - Basic Nginx configuration for reverse proxy

3. **Deployment Scripts**
   - `deploy.sh` - Builds and starts the Docker containers
   - `ec2-setup.sh` - Sets up an EC2 instance with required software
   - `setup-ssl.sh` - Sets up SSL certificates with Let's Encrypt
   - `backup.sh` - Creates backups of your application
   - `restore.sh` - Restores from backups
   - `monitor.sh` - Monitors the health of your application

4. **Documentation**
   - `AWS-EC2-SETUP.md` - Detailed instructions for setting up an EC2 instance
   - `DEPLOYMENT.md` - Comprehensive deployment guide

## Next Steps

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose Locally** (if you want to test locally)
   - For macOS: Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - For Windows: Install Docker Desktop from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
   - For Linux: Follow the instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/

2. **Test Locally** (optional)
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   Access the application at http://localhost:3000

3. **Set Up AWS Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to https://aws.amazon.com/
   - Click "Create an AWS Account"
   - Follow the registration process

4. **Launch EC2 Instance**
   - Follow the instructions in `AWS-EC2-SETUP.md`

5. **Deploy to EC2**
   - Upload all files to your EC2 instance
   - Run the setup and deployment scripts as described in `DEPLOYMENT.md`

6. **Set Up Domain and SSL** (optional, but recommended for production)
   - Register a domain if you don't have one
   - Point your domain to your EC2 instance's IP address
   - Run the SSL setup script

## Testing Your Deployment

After deploying to EC2, you can verify everything is working by:

1. Accessing your application via the EC2 instance's public IP address
2. Running the monitoring script to check the health of your services
3. Checking the logs if you encounter any issues

## Cost Optimization

Remember that AWS charges for EC2 instances based on usage. To minimize costs:

1. Use t2.micro or t3.micro instances (free tier eligible for 12 months)
2. Stop the instance when not in use for development/testing
3. Consider using Reserved Instances for long-term production use

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues during deployment:

1. Check the troubleshooting section in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
2. Review the Docker and AWS EC2 documentation
3. Use AWS support or community forums for AWS-specific issues
